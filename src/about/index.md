## The Name
About 15 years ago, I was living in Manahattan's Morningside Heights with my two brothers in a studio apartment in what can only be referred to as the 1980's sitcom phase of my adult life.

The winters in NYC can get cold and my cuban father who lived in Florida was obviously concerned with his children's core body temperatures.

My brother came home from the post office one day, placed a box on the table and declared, matter-of-factly, "Dad Sends Sweaters."

## The Rest
This is the web home of software engineer and (former) wine steward Jos√© Arenado. He'll post things he finds interesting. He will use this as a place to naval-gaze, opine, and make needlessly crass jokes even a 15-year-old would find nauseating.

He is me.

You're welcome.

I spent a significant part of my life consuming obscene amounts of street drugs and alcohol. It's likely that I'm misremembering this exchange a bit. But the general theme is sound.</small>
