The park never fails to amaze.

The trail that surrounds the prospect park in south brooklyn is fucking glorious[?].

it goes around the lake in Prospect Park.

The water framed by all those old trees the names of which I'll never know.

The abundundant urban wildlife -- geese, warblers, squirrels, ducks. Lindsey favorites: turtles.

No better way to get those steps, lol.

It's so close to my apartment, yet I've only been on this hike maybe twice.
